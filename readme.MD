# Design Patterns in Practice

This project demonstrates six common design patterns using simple, practical JavaScript code examples. Each design pattern is implemented in a self-contained mini-example, showcasing its typical use case and advantages. The patterns covered in this project include:

1. [Singleton](./creational-patterns/singleton-pattern/)
2. [Builder](./creational-patterns/builder-pattern/)
3. [Iterator](./behavioral-patterns/iterator-pattern/)
4. [Strategy](./behavioral-patterns/strategy-pattern/)
5. [Decorator](./structural-patterns/decorator-pattern/)
6. [Facade](./structural-patterns/facade-pattern/)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/viragdebora/design-patterns-demo.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd design-patterns-demo

3. Install dependencies:

## Usage

Each design pattern example is located in its own directory under the corresponding patter folder. You can run them individually the scripts that use can find in the `package.json` file.

For example if you would like to run the Singleton pattern:

   ```bash
   npm run singletonPattern
